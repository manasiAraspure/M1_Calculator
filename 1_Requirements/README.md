# Requirements
## Introduction
 * Calculator is a electronic device which is used to solve mathematices which are faced by us in our daily life. Most of the calculator perform arithematic operations like addition, substraction, multiplication, and division. This project focus on numbers and arithematic operations which is build in C Programming language. I have added some other operations like Factorial, Fibonacci,Square, Square Root, Cube and Cube root.

## Research
* In Reference with https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/examples/calculator-switch-case.
Switch Case is use to implement the calculator. The switch statement allows us to execute one code block among many alternatives. This takes an operator and two or more operands from the user And performs the calculation on operands on basis of the option selected by the user. 
* **Break** statement plays and important role. It ends the a loop or any block of code when it is encountered and executed.

## Strengths
* Provide accurate result of any calculation easily
* User Friendly
* Quick and Efficient

## Weakness
* Right now it doesn't include all the possible operations.
* Can not store the results for future use.
* Only work with single input output.
* only interger values gets evaluated.

## OPPORTUNITIES   
* Calculators can be used as for the big calculations and to solve scientific calculations.
* Now a days Calculator are available in every software based devices like computer and mobile phones, etc.

## THREATS
* No Skill-Building. Calculators take away the necessity for a student to know the basics.
* Cheating. The availability of graphic calculators has made it easier for students to cheat during their tests.

## Operations Includes 
### 1 Arithematic Operation
