## Introduction
* Calculator is a electronic device which is used to solve mathematices which are faced by us in our daily life. Most of the calculator perform arithematic operations like addition, substraction, multiplication, and division. This project focus on numbers and arithematic operations which is build in C Programming language. I have added some other operations like Factorial, Fibonacci,Square, Square Root, Cube and Cube root.

* The end result of the calculator is its ability to process number and operators, and provides a useful results. For example, the Addition function returns the sum of 2 numbers.
